silver.epd
# NEW Silver Openings Suite
# The suite cover most all of the major openings and systems, as well as types of positions. 
# The openings also appear according to their frequency in actual play, therefore the number 
# of Sicilians, for example, is actually proportionate to the frequency they are played compared 
# to other openings, etc. This was done via database statistics in Mega Database 2010 with 4.5 million games.
#
# Beyond the actual openings, I have also strived to include all the major types of formations, 
# such as a stonewall, a hedgehog, an isolani, a KIA, etc.
